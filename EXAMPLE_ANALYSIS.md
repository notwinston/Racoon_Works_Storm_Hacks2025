# Example Files Analysis

## Overview
Based on the input files in the `input/` directory, here's what our algorithm would process:

## Example 1 (example1.txt)
- **Total Memory**: 42,467,328 bytes (~40.5 MB)
- **Nodes**: 82 nodes
- **Format**: Standard format with node IDs, operations, input counts, and memory/time values
- **Key Operations**: ExpandDims, Sub, Mul, Transpose, RealDiv, BatchMatMul, Add, Softmax, DropoutGenMask, DropoutDoMask, SoftmaxBackward, AddN, Return

### Sample Nodes:
```
0 ExpandDims-op0 0 0 524288 59      # No inputs, 524KB run mem, 0 output mem, 59 time
1 Sub-op0 1 0 0 524288 525          # 1 input (node 0), 524KB run mem, 0 output mem, 525 time
2 Mul-op0 1 1 0 524288 691          # 1 input (node 1), 524KB run mem, 0 output mem, 691 time
7 BatchMatMul-op0 2 4 6 0 8388608 505  # 2 inputs (nodes 4,6), 0 run mem, 8MB output mem, 505 time
```

## Example 2 (example2.txt)
- **Total Memory**: 85,983,232 bytes (~82 MB)
- **Nodes**: 82 nodes (same structure as example1)
- **Difference**: Higher memory limit, same node structure

## Example 3 (example3.txt)
- **Total Memory**: 33,555,968 bytes (~32 MB)
- **Nodes**: 89 nodes
- **Difference**: Lower memory limit, more nodes, some nodes have different run_mem values

### Notable Differences:
```
3 Transpose-op0 0 1536 2097152 384  # Has run_mem=1536 (unlike examples 1&2)
7 BatchMatMul-op0 2 4 6 10487296 8388608 577  # Has run_mem=10487296
```

## Example 4 (example4.txt)
- **Total Memory**: 54,527,488 bytes (~52 MB)
- **Nodes**: 89 nodes (same structure as example3)
- **Difference**: Higher memory limit than example3

## Example 5 (example5.txt)
- **Total Memory**: 62,277,025,792 bytes (~58 GB)
- **Nodes**: 238,319 nodes (massive!)
- **Operations**: Equal, Cast, Mul operations
- **Scale**: This is a very large graph that would require significant optimization

### Sample Nodes:
```
0 Equal-op0 0 0 170393600 548       # 170MB output memory
1 Cast-op0 1 0 0 681574400 264      # 650MB output memory
2 Mul-op0 1 1 0 681574400 661       # 650MB output memory
```

## Algorithm Behavior Analysis

### Memory Constraints
- **Example 1**: Max single node memory = 8MB (BatchMatMul), Memory limit = 40.5MB ✅
- **Example 2**: Max single node memory = 8MB, Memory limit = 82MB ✅
- **Example 3**: Max single node memory = 10.5MB, Memory limit = 32MB ⚠️ (tight)
- **Example 4**: Max single node memory = 10.5MB, Memory limit = 52MB ✅
- **Example 5**: Max single node memory = 650MB, Memory limit = 58GB ✅

### Scheduling Challenges

#### Example 1 & 2 (82 nodes)
- **Dependency Chain**: Linear progression with some branching
- **Memory Pressure**: Moderate (8MB max vs 40-82MB limit)
- **Strategy**: Sequential execution with minimal recomputation needed
- **Expected Time**: Sum of all node times (sequential execution)

#### Example 3 (89 nodes, tight memory)
- **Memory Pressure**: High (10.5MB max vs 32MB limit)
- **Strategy**: May require recomputation of intermediate nodes
- **Challenge**: BatchMatMul nodes with 10.5MB run memory need careful scheduling
- **Expected Time**: Likely higher than sum due to recomputation

#### Example 4 (89 nodes, relaxed memory)
- **Memory Pressure**: Low (10.5MB max vs 52MB limit)
- **Strategy**: Similar to example3 but with more flexibility
- **Expected Time**: Close to optimal sequential execution

#### Example 5 (238,319 nodes, massive scale)
- **Memory Pressure**: Very low (650MB max vs 58GB limit)
- **Strategy**: Focus on time optimization rather than memory
- **Challenge**: Computational complexity of scheduling 238K nodes
- **Expected Time**: Dominated by algorithm complexity, not memory constraints

## Expected Algorithm Performance

### Research Paper Optimizations Applied:

1. **Sequential Peak Calculation (Equation 2)**
   - Predicts memory usage before executing each node
   - Critical for examples 3 and 4 with tight memory

2. **Negative Node Optimization (Section 5.2)**
   - Identifies nodes that free memory (negative impact)
   - Helps in examples 1-4 where memory management is important

3. **Clustering Detection (Properties 1 & 2)**
   - Identifies nodes that must execute consecutively
   - Reduces search space for all examples

4. **Recomputation Scoring**
   - Prioritizes nodes with high output memory and low time cost
   - Most useful for examples 3 and 4

### Expected Results:

| Example | Memory Limit | Max Node Memory | Expected Strategy | Time Complexity |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | 40.5MB | 8MB | Sequential, minimal recomputation | O(n) |
| 2 | 82MB | 8MB | Sequential, minimal recomputation | O(n) |
| 3 | 32MB | 10.5MB | Recomputation required | O(n²) worst case |
| 4 | 52MB | 10.5MB | Sequential with flexibility | O(n) |
| 5 | 58GB | 650MB | Time-optimized scheduling | O(n log n) |

## Implementation Notes

The algorithm would:
1. Parse each file using the InputParser
2. Build dependency graphs and calculate impact values
3. Apply research paper optimizations
4. Generate execution schedules respecting memory constraints
5. Output execution order and statistics

For examples 1-4, the algorithm should find feasible solutions. For example 5, the large scale would require efficient data structures and potentially parallel processing.
